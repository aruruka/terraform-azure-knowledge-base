# Project Brief

I am currently taking an online course. The course is from the online training institution - "Udemy". Course name: "A Practical, Step-by-Step Guide to Building and Automating Azure Infrastructure with Terraform". The course author is Mark Tinderholt.

This project aims to build a practical knowledge base about Terraform. My memory is not good, so I hope to use this to assist my work, making this knowledge base a cheat sheet. When I encounter technical problems, I can ask LLMs questions, using the content from this project as reference material, and have the LLM provide me with answers.
